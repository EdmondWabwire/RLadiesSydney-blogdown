bio: R-Ladies Sydney is devoted to promoting gender diversity in the R community. We run monthly meetups that create a welcoming and inclusive enviornment for you to learn R. You can join our meetup group here and see some events that we have run recently. We also run informal #ShutUpAndCode sessions and have designed a set of online modules called #RYouWithMe to help beginners get up to speed.
